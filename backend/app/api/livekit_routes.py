    Generate a LiveKit room token for the authenticated user.

    SECURITY: room_name is caller-supplied, and campaign_id/contact_id are
    used only to build participant metadata — none of that was previously
    checked against the caller's own tenant. That meant any authenticated
    user could mint a token for *any* room_name (including one belonging to
    another business's live call) and join it to listen in or speak.
    Two fixes:
      1. If campaign_id/contact_id are supplied, verify they belong to the
         caller's business before embedding them in the token metadata.
      2. Namespace the actual LiveKit room by business_id server-side, so a
         user can never join a room outside their own tenant's namespace
         regardless of what room_name string they pass.
